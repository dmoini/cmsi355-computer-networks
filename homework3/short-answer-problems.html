        <p>6.20) If the maximum frequency audible to a human ear is 20,000 Hz, at what rate must the analog signal from a microphone be sampled when converting it to digital?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2*f_{max}=2*20,000Hz=40,000Hz" title="2*f_{max}=2*20,000Hz=40,000Hz" />
</li>
</ul>
<p>7.2) What are the three energy types used when classifying physical media according to energy used?</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrical, light, and electromagnetic/radio.</li>
</ul>
<p>7.8) Explain why light does not leave an optical fiber when the fiber is bent into an arc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since an arced fiber cable has a critical angle greater than 90Â°, light within the cable reflects as if the boundaries were a mirror. This keeps the light within the cable rather than allowing it to pass through the cable.</li>
</ul>
<p>7.23) If a system has an average power level of 100, an average noise level of 33.33, and a bandwidth of 100 MHz, what is the effective limit on channel capacity?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?B*log_{2}(1&plus;\frac{S}{N})=100*10^{6}*log_{2}(1&plus;\frac{100}{33.33})=10^{8}*2.00010819807=200,010,819.81" title="B*log_{2}(1+\frac{S}{N})=100*10^{6}*log_{2}(1+\frac{100}{33.33})=10^{8}*2.00010819807=200,010,819.81" />
</li>
</ul>
<p>13.8) What are the four basic LAN topologies?</p>
<ul>
<li>Bus: a single cable to which computers attach.</li>
<li>Ring: arranges computers to be connected in a closed loop.</li>
<li>Star: all computers attach to a central point.</li>
<li>Mesh: provides a direct connection between each pair of computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>13.11) Given an IEEE MAC address, how can one tell if the address refers to unicast?</p>
<ul>
<li>In a 48-bit IEEE MAC address, the value of the 8th most significant bit determines whether the address refers to unicast (0) or multicast (1).</li>
</ul>
<p>18.12) What are the two basic approaches used to perform a distributed route computation, and how does each work?</p>
<ul>
<li>Link State Routing (LSR): each packet switch broadcasts status messages to all switches in the network. Each switch collects incoming status messages and uses them to build a graph of the network. Each switch then uses a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm to build a forwarding table, and chooses itself as the source.</li>
<li>Distance-vector routing (DVR): each packet switch sends DVR messages, which contain distances to other switches, to its neighbors. These DVR messages are used to update the receiving switch's forwarding table.</li>
</ul>
<p>21.4) Write a computer program that accepts a dotted decimal address as input and displays a string of 32 bits.</p>
<ul>
<li>View <a href="iputils.py">dotted_decimal_quad_to_binary()</a></li>
</ul>
<p>21.5) Write a computer program that reads an IP address in dotted decimal form and determines whether the address is a multicast address.</p>
<ul>
<li>View <a href="iputils.py">is_dotted_quad_multicast()</a></li>
</ul>
<p>21.6) Write a computer program that translates between CIDR slash notation and an equivalent dotted decimal value.</p>
<ul>
<li>View <a href="iputils.py">cidr_to_dotted_quad() and dotted_quad_to_cidr()</a></li>
</ul>
<p>21.7) If an ISP assigned you a / 28 address block, how many computers could you assign an address?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2^{32-28}-2=2^{4}-2=16-2=14" title="2^{32-28}-2=2^{4}-2=16-2=14" />
</li>
</ul>
<p>21.8) If an ISP offers a / 17 address block for N dollars per month and a / 16 address block for 1.5 N dollars per month, which has the cheapest cost per computer?</p>
<ul>
<li>/ 17 address cost per computer:
<ul>
<li># of computers (C) = <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2^{32-17}-2=2^{15}-2" title="2^{32-17}-2=2^{15}-2" /></li>
<li>Total cost per month = <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{N}{C}=\frac{N}{2^{15}-2}" title="\frac{N}{C}=\frac{N}{2^{15}-2}" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>/ 16 address cost per computer:
<ul>
<li># of computers (C) = <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2^{32-16}-2=2^{16}-2" title="2^{32-16}-2=2^{16}-2" /></li>
<li>Total cost per month = <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{1.5N}{C}=\frac{1.5N}{2^{16}-2}\approx\frac{0.75N}{2^{15}-2}" title="\frac{1.5N}{C}=\frac{1.5N}{2^{16}-2}\approx\frac{0.75N}{2^{15}-2}" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>/ 16 address has cheaper cost per computer</li>
</ul>
<p>21.9) Is the CIDR prefix 1.2.3.4 / 29 valid? Why or why not?</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not valid because this prefix zeroes out the first 29 bits, but the 4 at the end means the 29th MSB is not zeroed out. The correct CIDR prefix for this would be 1.2.3.0 / 29.
21.10) Suppose you are an ISP with a / 24 address block. Explain whether you accommodate a request from a customer who needs addresses for 255 computers. (Hint: consider the special addresses.)</li>
<li>An ISP with a / 24 address block could accommodate this many computers: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2^{32&space;-&space;24}-2=2^8-2=256-2=254" title="2^{32 - 24}-2=2^8-2=256-2=254" />. Even though it could accommodate 256 combination of bits, the suffix being all 0's is reserved for the network and the suffix being all 1's is reserved for the directed broadcast. Therefore, no.</li>
</ul>
<p>21.11) Suppose you are an ISP that owns a / 22 address block. Show the CIDR allocation you would use to allocate address blocks to four customers who need addresses for 60 computers each.</p>
<ul>
<li>/22 means that we have 2^10 computers. We can fit 60 computers in a /26 because a /26 allows 6 bits for each allocation, meaning each customer would have 2^6 - 2 = 62 available addresses for computers. With this information, a possible CIDR allocation could be ddd.ddd.ddd.0/26, ddd.ddd.ddd.64/26, ddd.ddd.ddd.128/26, ddd.ddd.ddd.192/26, where ddd.ddd.ddd is the same for all four customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>21.12) Suppose you are an ISP that owns a / 22 address block. Can you accommodate requests from six customers who need addresses for 9, 15, 20, 41, 128, and 260 computers, respectively? If so, how? If not, explain why.</p>
<ul>
<li>For 9 computers, we need <strong>4 bits</strong> to accommodate. This covers the range 123.45.0.1-14, which can hold 9 computers.</li>
<li>For 15 computers, we need <strong>5 bits</strong> to accommodate. This covers the range 123.45.0.1-30, which can hold 15 computers.</li>
<li>For 20 computers, we need <strong>5 bits</strong> to accommodate. This covers the range 123.45.0.1-30, which can hold 20 computers.</li>
<li>For 41 computers, we need <strong>6 bits</strong> to accommodate. This covers the range 123.45.0.1-62, which can hold 41 computers.</li>
<li>For 128 computers, we need <strong>8 bits</strong> to accommodate. This covers the range 123.45.0.1-254, which can hold 128 computers.</li>
<li>For 260 computers, we need <strong>8 bits</strong> to accommodate first 254 hosts and an additional <strong>3 bits</strong> to accommodate remaining 6 hosts. This covers the range 123.45.0.1-254 and 123.45.1.1-6.</li>
</ul>
<p>21.13) Write a computer program that reads an address in CIDR notation and prints the resulting address and mask in binary.</p>
<ul>
<li>View <a href="iputils.py">cidr_to_address_and_mask_in_binary()</a></li>
</ul>
<p>23.2) What term is used to describe the mapping between a protocol address and a hardware address?</p>
<ul>
<li>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</li>
</ul>
<p>23.5) How many octets does an ARP message occupy when used with IP and Ethernet addresses?</p>
<ul>
<li>IP: 4 octets</li>
<li>Ethernet: 6 octets</li>
</ul>
<p>23.22) Many NAT devices choose the 10.0.0.0/8 address block from Figure 23.10 because it provides the most generality. Explain why.</p>
<ul>
<li>From the given private addresses, 10.0.0.0/8 allows for the largest number of hosts. Since the mask is 8, this allows for 24 host bits, meaning up to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?24^{2}-2" title="24^{2}-2" /> hosts, compared to the other options with masks of 12 or 16.</li>
</ul>
<p>24.3) List the major features of IPv6, and give a short description of each.</p>
<ul>
<li>Address size: each IPv6 header is 128 bits.</li>
<li>Header format: the IPv6 header format has drastically changed from IPv4's header format. Changes include:
<ul>
<li>IPv6 headers are twice as large as IPv4 headers</li>
<li>Source address and destination address fields occupy 16 octets of space (4 times the space compared to IPv4)</li>
<li>Includes the field <em>TRAFFIC CLASS</em> that specifies the traffic class for the datagram (low latency, low jitter, etc...).</li>
<li>The <em>PAYLOAD LENGTH</em>, which corresponds to IPv4's datagram length field, specifies only the size of the carried data, not the header size.</li>
<li><em>HOP LIMIT</em> corresponds to IPv4's <em>TIME TO LIVE</em>.</li>
<li>Each header includes a <em>NEXT HEADER</em> field, specifying the type of information that follows the current header.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extension headers: IPv6 datagrams encode information into a variable number of separate headers rather than a fixed-length single header.</li>
<li>Support for real-time traffic: allows a sender and receiver to establish a high-quality path through the underlying network, meaning datagrams sent between the two avoid route changes and preserve such high-quality.</li>
<li>Extensible protocol: IPv6 does not specify all possible protocol features. Due to the addition of extension headers, datagrams can have additional information added to them, and new protocol features can be added when needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>24.9) Write a computer program that reads a 128-bit binary number and prints the number in colon hex notation.</p>
<ul>
<li>View <a href="iputils.py">binary_to_colon_hex())</a></li>
</ul>
