1. What are the two basic communication paradigms used in the Internet?
    - Stream (client-server) and message (P2P).
2) Give six characteristics of Internet stream communication.
    - Connection-oriented
    - 1-to-1 communication
    - Transfers a sequence of individual bytes
    - An arbitrary length transfer
    - Used by most applications
    - Built on TCP protocol
3. Give six characteristics of Internet message communication.
    - Connectionless
    - Many-to-many communication
    - Transfers a sequence of individual messages
    - Each message limited to 64 kilobytes
    - Used for multimedia applications
    - Built on UDP protocol
4) If a sender uses the stream paradigm and always sends 1024 bytes at a time, what size blocks can the Internet deliver to a receiver?
    - Any size blocks that total up to 1024 bytes.
5. If a sender wants to have copies of each data block being sent to three recipients, which paradigm should the sender choose?
    - The message paradigm since it provides 1-to-many communication the ability to multicast to some of the devices on a network.
6) What are the three surprising aspects of the Internetâ€™s message delivery semantics?
    - It permits messages to be lost, duplicated, and delivered out of order.
7. Give the general algorithm that a connection-oriented system uses.
    - First, a pair of applications requests a connection. 
    Then the pair uses the connection to exchange data until the pair requests that the connection be terminated.
9) Compare and contrast a client and server application by summarizing characteristics of each.
    - A server starts first, does not need to know which client will contact it, waits passively and arbitrarily long for contact from a client, and stays running after servicing one client, and waits for another.
    On the other hand, a client starts second, must know which server to contact, initiates a contact whenever communication is needed, and may terminate after interacting with a server.
    Both, however, communicate with each other by sending and receiving data.
10. What is the difference between a server and a server-class computer?
    - A server refers to a program that waits passively for communication while a server-class computer is dedicated to running one or more server programs.
11) Can data flow from a client to a server? Explain.
    - Once contact has been established between a client and a server, two-way communication is possible.
    Typically, data flowing from a client to a server is a request sent to a server, following the server returning a response to the client.
12. List the possible combinations of clients and servers a given computer can run.
    - A single client, a single server, multiple copies of a client that contact a given server, multiple clients that each contact a particular server, and multiple servers, each for a particular service.
13) Can all computers run multiple services effectively? Why or why not?
    - No. Weaker computers that are unable to handle multiple programs at the same time cannot run multiple services effectively.
    However, a more powerful computer is able to offer multiple services effectively, where a separate server program is needed for each service.
14. What two identifiers are used to specify a particular server?
    - IP address and port number.
15) List the steps a client uses to contact a server after a user specifies a domain name for the server.
    - Use DNS to translate name to IP address.
    - Specify that the service uses port N.
    - Contact server and interact.
16. What basic operating system feature does a concurrent server use to handle requests from multiple clients simultaneously?
    - Threads of execution.
17) What performance problem motivates peer-to-peer communication?
    - Central bottleneck.
18. Name two operating systems that offer the socket API.
    - Microsoft Windows and Linux.
19) Once a socket is created, how does an application reference the socket?
    - The operating system returns a small integer *descriptor* that the application uses to reference the socket.
20. What are the main functions in the socket API?
    - Accept, bind, close, connect, getpeername, getsockopt, listen, recv, recvmsg, recvfrom, send, sendmsg, sendto, setsockopt, shutdown, and socket.
21) Give the typical sequence of socket calls used by a client and by a server.
    - Client
      - socket
      - connect
      - send
      - recv (can loop back to send)
      - close
    - Server
      - socket
      - bind
      - listen
      - accept
      - recv
      - send (can loop back to recv)
      - close (can loop back to accept)
22. To what socket functions do read and write correspond?
    - recv and send respectively.
23) Does a client ever use bind? Explain.
    - No. <!-- TODO: explain -->
