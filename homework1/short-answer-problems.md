1. What was the name of the famous 1974 paper by Cerf and Kahn and why was it so influential?
    * The name of the name of the famous 1974 paper by Cerf and Kahn is *A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication*.
    It was so influential because it described the TCP Protocol.
    Back in the early 70's, the ARPANET and other data networks could not communicate with each other because of different hardware and software protocols. 
    The TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) essentially laid the groundwork for open-architecture networking, as it was a cross-network protocol that allowed computers to freely speak to each other regardless of hardware or software constraints. 
    This international network of computer networks became the foundation for the Internet as we know it today.
