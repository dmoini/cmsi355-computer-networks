26.15) Suppose two programs use TCP to establish a connection, communicate, terminate the connection, and then open a new connection. Further suppose a FIN message sent to shut down the first connection is duplicated and delayed until the second connection has been established. If a copy of the old FIN is delivered, will TCP terminate the new connection? Why or why not?
